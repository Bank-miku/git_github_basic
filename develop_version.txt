Develope of version control
1. copy file & folder

3. Local Version Control Systems: These systems store changes locally in files 
as hotfixes or patches before being pushed to a single version of code in a database.

4. Centralized Version Control Systems (CVCS): These systems host different versions 
of the code in a centralized repository. Users can access these versions and push or 
pull changes as needed.

5. Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCS): These systems contain multiple repositories.
Each user has their own repository and working copy. Changes are committed locally and 
then pushed to a central repository. Git and Mercurial are popular examples of DVCS.
Git is also DVCS
