1. what is version control

Version control, also known as source control, 
is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code. 
It is an essential tool for software development, enabling teams to work 
collaboratively and efficiently. 
Version control systems (VCS) are software tools that help manage changes to 
source code over time.

Key Principles

Version control systems keep track of every modification to the code in a special kind of database.
If a mistake is made, developers can turn back the clock and compare earlier versions of the code to 
help fix the mistake while minimizing disruption to all team members. This is particularly useful for 
DevOps teams as it helps reduce development time and increase successful deployments.

2. why we need to use version control

+ Enhanced Collaboration: Multiple developers can work on the same project simultaneously 
without overwriting each other's changes.

+ Historical Record: A complete long-term change history of every file, including the creation
 and deletion of files as well as edits to their contents.

+ Branching and Merging: Developers can work on independent streams of changes and merge them back together,
 ensuring that changes do not conflict.

+ Traceability: Each change can be traced back to its author, date, and purpose, which is useful for root 
cause analysis and understanding the evolution of the project.

+ Disaster Recovery: In case of any disaster or contingent situation, version control helps in recovery 
by allowing developers to revert to previous versions.
